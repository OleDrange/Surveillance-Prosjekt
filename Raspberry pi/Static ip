Setup a Static IP Address
Questions about setting Static IP Address are among the most common on this site. There are very many tutorials (many wrong, obsolete or incomplete).

Disclaimer
Before proceeding I feel obliged to state that setting up a static address is NOT recommended. Telecommunications Engineers do not do this. Static IP Addresses can be the bane of a Network Administrator's life. There are situations where Static IP Addresses are necessary e.g. if you are running a DHCP server, or running on an isolated network with no DHCP server.

If you are determined to proceed anyway you should make sure you get it right. Adapted from Foundation Network Tutorial

Find the Settings of your local Network
This is most easily done with the Pi itself, using DHCP, but can be done on any computer on your network, although the commands may differ on other systems.

Run

ip -4 addr show | grep global
which should give an output like:

inet 10.1.1.30/24 brd 10.1.1.255 scope global eth0
inet 10.1.1.31/24 brd 10.1.1.255 scope global wlan0
The first address is the IP address of your Pi on the network, and the part after the slash is the network size. It is highly likely that yours will be a /24.

The second address is the brd (broadcast) address of the network.

Find the address of your router (or gateway)

ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3}'

10.1.1.1
Finally note down the address of your DNS server, which is often the same as your gateway.

cat /etc/resolv.conf

# Generated by resolvconf
nameserver 10.1.1.1
Then follow ONE of the following methods. (There are other methods not documented here. These are the most common on Raspbian.) (In either method substitute the appropriate network interface name for eth0, wlan0 or predictable network interface names.)

If you want to find the interface names, even if not connected, run the following command ls /sys/class/net/

In either method you should choose IP addresses which are not in use; ideally outside the range used by your DHCP server, within the same sub-network.

dhcpcd method
Leave /etc/network/interfaces at its default (as above).

Edit /etc/dhcpcd.conf as follows:-

 Here is an example which configures a static address, routes and dns.
       interface eth0
       static ip_address=10.1.1.30/24
       static routers=10.1.1.1
       static domain_name_servers=10.1.1.1

       interface wlan0
       static ip_address=10.1.1.31/24
       static routers=10.1.1.1
       static domain_name_servers=10.1.1.1
ip_address is the address and size from the command above (or another unused address on the same network), routers is the address of your router (or gateway). domain_name_servers is the DNS address(es) from /etc/resolv.conf. (see man dhcpcd.conf)

There is a good article on dhcpcd at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/dhcpcd The Fallback profile is an alternative to static IP
